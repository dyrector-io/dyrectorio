## Overview

dyrector.io helps engineer & DevOps teams and individual developers to shift their focus from maintaining and setting up their containerized applications to developing their software. The platform achieves this by offering continuous delivery and version management capabilities to your OCI containers.

> **Warning**
> The platform is under development, please treat as such. Expect bugs here and there. Early adopters welcome.

## Getting started
You have various options to set up the platform right away:
- [CLI](./GETTING_STARTED.md) 
- [SaaS](#hosted-version-saas) 
- [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml)

## üåä Use cases

#### üö¢ Manage environments without SSH or kubectl

Replace multiple tools with a single platform that allows you to manage your entire infrastructure and the containerized applications that run on it. You're also able to initiate deployments to multiple environments simultaneously instead of repeated, manual processes.

#### ‚õ¥Ô∏è Instant test environments for QA

QA no longer needs help to test your services. Empower QA to independently configure and deploy different versions of microservices to a test environment on their own. They can turn even their own local machine or any remote infrastructure they have access to, into a test environment.

#### ‚õµÔ∏è Container management across environments

Whether you're a developer or an indie hacker, bring your own infrastructure and manage all of your containers and applications from one place while our software is running either as a SaaS or on your infrastructure.

#### üõ≥Ô∏è CD & Version Management

Bring transparency to your SDLC by configuring versions and deployments of your containerized stack from any registry using our platform. Automate your deployments by generating a CD token you can use with GitHub Actions and turn deployments painless and effortless while you can focus more on the development of your software.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Manage container settings without access

Editing container settings no longer requires direct access or expertise in JSON formatting. Our platform provides a user-friendly JSON editor, enabling you to modify settings without accessing the containers. In case of deployment issues, you can easily make necessary adjustments using the platform's config editor screen. Additionally, you can create bundle configurations to avoid manual configuration for each container.

## Hosted version (SaaS)

Besides the self-hosted instance, you can check out the platform's alpha at [app.dyrectorio.com](https://app.dyrectorio.com). The platform is still in the works, we might reset the database, so it's not recommended for production yet. In case you are interested about using dyrector.io in production, reach out to us via [email](hello@dyrector.io) and we'll set up a stable instance for you.

## How it works

dyrector.io consists of an agent (GoLang) and a platform (UI developed in React.js, Next.js. Backend developed in Node.js, Nest.js). There are two types of agents communicating with the platform: one for Docker and another for Kubernetes. Communication takes place in gRPC with TLS encryption. The data is managed in a PostgreSQL database which we use with Prisma ORM.
