## Key features

- Kubernetes and Docker support
- Multi-instance deployment
- Instant test environments from any branches
- Environment management
- Secret and configuration management
- Auto-generated changelogs and release notes
- Workflow support
- Scheduled releases
- Audit log
- Container Registry integrations
- Fine-grained RBAC
- ChatOps & notification solutions

## Quick Start

### Prerequirements

- Install Docker and Docker Compose to your machine

### Development (Local)
The easiest way to get started with the dyrector.io platform is by our premade [docker-compose](./web/docker-compose.dev.yaml) file.

1. First you have to create `.env` from `.env.example` files in your local environment, in the following folders: `/web`, `/web/crux`, `/web/crux-ui`

On *Windows* and *Mac* use `host.docker.internal` in the `.env` files for URLs.

2. Build the dyrector.io platform dependencies, this step is only required once:
```
docker-compose -f web/docker-compose.dev.yaml build
```

3. To run the dyrector.io platform dependencies:
```
docker-compose -f web/docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

If you are having problems starting `crux-kratos-migrate` change the line endings of `web/kratos/entrypoint.sh` from CRLF to LF. These problems include `ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.` while running `docker-compose up` or `': No such file or directory` in the container log.

4. Now as all the infrastructure is ready, you need to install all the node.js dependencies in the specific projects' folder. To install all (  `web/crux/`, `web/crux-ui/` ) dependencies run `npm install`.

_on Apple Silicon run `npm install --target_arch=x64`_

5. In `crux/` folder you have to migrate the database and generate the Prisma client
```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

6. Create a reCaptcha v3 key pair and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` in `/web/crux-ui/.env`. Make sure to use `localhost` or `host.internal` as the domain.

7. To start services run `npm start` in the followind folders `/web/crux` and `/web/crux-ui`

8. Open the platform in `host.docker.internal:8000` and register

9. In local our auth service is using a mock, so you can confirm your email in `http://localhost:4436/`

10. Now you can log in and use the platform

### Hosted version (SaaS)

We are planning to support a hosted version in the near future.
