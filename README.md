Imagine that Heroku meets Portainer and then gets combined with fly.io â€“ thatâ€™s dyrector.io. It enables teams to build up their software delivery pipeline like building blocks.

## Overview

dyrector.io is an open-source container management platform that helps software teams to manage releases & deployments efficiently. While non-specialists are enabled to manage these processes in a simplified, self-service manner, specialists can customize and manage containerized apps faster through the platform.

Our product is a platform for:

-   **DevOps & System Engineers** can build and manage robust cloud infrastructure
-   **Engineers** can focus more on developing the product because self-service deployments are faster
-   **Stakeholders** can deliver new functions and products with a higher velocity
-   **CTOs & Technical Managers** can reduce time-to-market, manage cloud costs more efficiently and maintain team productivity.

> **Warning**
> dyrector.io platform is under development, please treat as such. Expect bugs here and there. Early adopters welcome.

## Getting Started

Our CLI tool lets you run and manage the whole dyrector.io project's containers, you will have a fully-featured platform locally.

Stack:

-   UI Service (crux-ui)
-   Backend Service (crux)
-   PostgreSQL database
-   Authentication (Ory Kratos)
-   Migrations
-   SMTP mail test server

### Prerequirements

-   Docker installed on your system (Podman works, too).
-   Go Compiler to run the CLI from its source code. (Precompiled binaries are planned)

### Option 1: Go install

1. Execute `go install github.com/dyrector-io/dyrectorio/golang/cmd/dyo@develop`
2. Execute `dyo up`
3. After you navigated to `localhost:8000` (this is the default traefik port) you will see a Login screen
4. Register an account with whatever e-mail address you see fit (doesn't have to be valid one)
5. Navigate to `localhost:4436` where you will find your mail as all outgoing e-mails will land here
6. Open your e-mail message and using the link inside you can activate your account
7. Happy deploying! ðŸŽ¬

### Option 2: From Source

1. Clone the repository to your local workdir with `git clone`
2. Execute `make up` in the project root
3. Open the `localhost:8000`
4. Happy deploying! ðŸŽ¬

## Development

1. Read the CLI documentation first(see the end of this section)
2. Decide which part of the project you want to work on, in this case it is crux, crux-ui or both
3. Modify the CLI's settings file if you need it.
4. Execute the correct CLI command using the appropriate flags to turn off crux or crux-ui services
5. Start crux or crux-ui with the appropriate `npm` command, usually `npm run start`
6. After you navigated to `localhost:8000` (this is the default traefik port) you will see a Login screen
7. Register an account with whatever e-mail address you see fit (doesn't have to be valid one)
8. Navigate to `localhost:4436` where you will find your mail as all outgoing e-mails will land here
9. Open your e-mail message and using the link inside you can activate your account
10. Fruitful contributing! ðŸŽ¬

Read more about the CLI in the [documentation](https://docs.dyrector.io/get-started/cli).

## Non-development

You can set up dyrectorio for self-hosting purposes with the [docker-compose](https://github.com/dyrector-io/dyrectorio/blob/develop/docker-compose.yaml) file located in the root folder.

## Hosted version (SaaS)

Besides the self-hosted instance of dyrectorio, you can check out the platform's alpha at [app.dyrectorio.com](https://app.dyrector.io). The platform is still in progress, we might reset the database, so it's not recommended for production yet. In case you are interested about using dyrectorio in production, reach out to us via email and we'll set up a stable instance for you.

## How it works

dyrector.io consists of an agent (GoLang) and a platform (UI developed in React.js, Next.js. Backend developed in Node.js, Nest.js). There are two types of agents communicating with the platform: one for Docker and another for Kubernetes. Communication takes place in gRPC with TLS encryption. The data is managed in a PostgreSQL database which we use with Prisma ORM.

## Use cases

### Multi-Instance Deployments

Trigger deployments of the same application to multiple environments from one place using the same or various configurations.

### Docker & Kubernetes utilization without specialists

Both Docker and Kubernetes require specialized staff to manage. Via dyrector.io, your teamâ€™s non-specialist staff can contribute to the process, as well.

### Instant test environments

Seamless testing whenever your team wants to test the application, without waiting for a SysAdmin to set up an environment.

## FAQ

-   Can we use dyrector.io without containerization?

    Unfortunately, we're unable to support applications that don't run in a containerization environment.

-   Will the tool remain completely free in the future, despite certain features only being accessible with a license key in upcoming versions, despite being open source?

    Our team consists of seven people, and although not all of them work on this project full-time, the majority do. We need to pay our engineers every month, and currently, we generate revenue by providing consultancy services. We are a fully independent team and do not have any investments. Our long-term goal is to work on this project full-time but to achieve this, we require funding.

    Our plan is to make the full project available for free if you choose to self-host it, but we also want to create a SaaS model where users can pay based on their usage. We don't have a complete plan for this yet. At present, we enjoy working on this project, collecting feedback, and making improvements to it.

-   What was the motivation behind making this tool?

    We were working on a totally different project that included self-service release management capabilities of containerized apps as a business requirement. Our client made a white labelled product that needed self-service deployments to redistribute the product. While Portainer and Yacht are amazing projects, we just couldn't find one serving our exact needs, so we decided to make our platform.

    After a while, we noticed that this is a bit of a niche use case, so we tried to extend its capabilities into an Internal Developer Platform direction so that it can be valuable to a lot of users. On top of these, we decided to make it open source so users can take a better look at the project before introducing it into their infrastructure.

-   How do I get in touch with the Support Team?

    You can contact dyrector.io support directly by reaching out to us via email at help@dyrector.io. Developers can get in touch via our Community Discord server.
