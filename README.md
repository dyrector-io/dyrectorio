## Overview

dyrector.io is an open-source deployment platform that helps software teams manage releases & deployments easily and efficiently. While non-specialists are enabled to manage these processes in a simplified, self-service manner, specialists can deploy and manage containerized apps faster through the platform.

Our product is a platform for:

-   **DevOps & System Engineers** can build and manage robust cloud infrastructure
-   **Engineers** can focus more on developing the product because self-service deployments are faster
-   **Stakeholders** can deliver new functions and products with a higher velocity
-   **CTOs & Technical Managers** can reduce time-to-market, manage cloud costs more efficiently and maintain team productivity.

> **Warning**
> dyrector.io platform is under development, please treat as such. Expect bugs here and there. Early adopters welcome.

## How it works

dyrector.io consists of an agent (GoLang) and a platform (UI developed in React.js, Next.js. Backend developed in Node.js, Nest.js). There are two types of agents communicating with the platform: one for Docker and another for Kubernetes. Communication takes place in gRPC with TLS encryption. The data is managed in a PostgreSQL database which we use with Prisma ORM.

## Use cases

### Multi-Instance Deployments

Trigger deployments of the same application to multiple environments from one place using the same or various configurations.

### Docker & Kubernetes utilization without specialists

Both Docker and Kubernetes require specialized staff to manage. Via dyrector.io, your teamâ€™s non-specialist staff can contribute to the process, as well.

### Instant test environments

Seamless testing whenever your team wants to test the application, without waiting for a SysAdmin to set up an environment.

## Get Started

dyrector.io CLI, is a command-line interface that lets you run and manage the whole dyrector.io project locally.

This means you get a full-featured dyrector.io platform running locally on your machine.

### Prerequirements

-   Docker installed on your system (Podman works, too).
-   Go Compiler to run the CLI from its source code. (Precompiled binaries are planned)

### With CLI

> **Note**
> The CLI is only available from the codebase at the moment.

1. Clone the repository to your local workdir with `git clone`
2. Execute `go run ./golang/cmd/dyo up` in the project root
3. Open the `localhost:8000` and use the platform

dyrector.io's command-line interface (CLI) lets you run a complete dyrector.io development environment locally with the following services: UI Service (crux-ui), Backend Service (crux), PostgreSQL databases, Authentication, Migrations, and SMTP mail server.

#### Using the platform with CLI for demonstration or testing

1. Execute `go run ./golang/cmd/dyo up` in the project root
2. After you navigated to `localhost:8000` (this is the default traefik port) you will see a Login screen
3. Register an account with whatever e-mail address you see fit (doesn't have to be valid one)
4. Navigate to `localhost:4436` where you will find your mail as all outgoing e-mails will land here
5. Open your e-mail message and using the link inside you can activate your account
6. Enjoy!

#### Using the platform with CLI for development

1. Read the CLI documentation first(see the end of this section)
2. Decide which part of the project you want to work on, in this case it is crux, crux-ui or both
3. Modify the CLI's settings file if you need it.
4. Execute the correct CLI command using the appropriate flags to turn off crux or crux-ui services
5. Start crux or crux-ui with the appropriate `npm` command, usually `npm run start`
6. After you navigated to `localhost:8000` (this is the default traefik port) you will see a Login screen
7. Register an account with whatever e-mail address you see fit (doesn't have to be valid one)
8. Navigate to `localhost:4436` where you will find your mail as all outgoing e-mails will land here
9. Open your e-mail message and using the link inside you can activate your account
10. Enjoy!

Read more about the CLI in the [documentation](https://docs.dyrector.io/get-started/cli).

### With Docker compose files

The easiest way to get started with the dyrector.io platform is by our premade [docker-compose](./web/docker-compose.dev.yaml) file.

1. First you have to create `.env` from `.env.example` files in your local environment, in the following folders: `/web`, `/web/crux`, `/web/crux-ui`

On _Windows_ and _Mac_ use `host.docker.internal` in the `.env` files for URLs.

2. Build the dyrector.io platform dependencies, this step is only required once:

```
docker-compose -f web/docker-compose.dev.yaml build
```

3. To run the dyrector.io platform dependencies:

```
docker-compose -f web/docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

If you are having problems starting `crux-kratos-migrate` change the line endings of `web/kratos/entrypoint.sh` from CRLF to LF. These problems include `ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.` while running `docker-compose up` or `': No such file or directory` in the container log.

4. Now as all the infrastructure is ready, you need to install all the node.js dependencies in the specific projects' folder. To install all ( `web/crux/`, `web/crux-ui/` ) dependencies run `npm install`.

_on Apple Silicon run `npm install --target_arch=x64`_

5. In `crux/` folder you have to migrate the database and generate the Prisma client

```
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

6. To start services run `npm start` in the followind folders `/web/crux` and `/web/crux-ui`

7. Open the platform in `host.docker.internal:8000` and register

8. In local our auth service is using a mock, so you can confirm your email in `http://localhost:4436/`

9. Now you can log in and use the platform

### Hosted version (SaaS)

We are planning to support a hosted version in the near future.
