# Register your Node

Regardless of the type of the target environment, you’ll have to register it as a Node in dyrector.io.

**Step 1:** Open Nodes on the left and click ‘Add’ on top right.

**Step 2:** Enter your Node’s name and select its icon.

Tip: You can write a description so others on your team can understand what’s the purpose of this Node.
{% endhint %}

**Step 3:** Click ‘Save’ and an ‘Install script’ button will show up. Click that button to generate a one-liner script.

**Step 4:** Run the one-liner in sh or bash.

The one-liner will generate a script that’ll set dyrector.io’s agent up on your Node.
