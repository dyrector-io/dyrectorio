#### Multi-Instance Deployments

Microservice architectures are challenging to manage, especially when your team has to distribute them through multiple Nodes. Deployments become repetitive, time-consuming, and due to human presence, risky.

By using dyrector.io, you can simplify the whole process. Assemble your images from private or public Docker Registries in an instant, then trigger the deployments to Nodes – on-prem or Kubernetes environments.

Bundled configurations enable your team to assign templatized configurations through the whole process. This significantly reduces the risk of adding incorrect configurations.

#### Docker & Kubernetes utilization without specialists

Both Docker and Kubernetes require specialized staff to manage. Via dyrector.io, your team’s non-specialist staff can contribute to the process, as well.

No worries if you’d rather have your specialists handling these processes, however. Your specialists can also save time and effort spent on image and containerized app management by using dyrector.io. They’ll even appreciate that their teammates can check on statuses on dyrector.io without looking for input and feedback from SysAdmins and DevOps staff.

#### Instant test environments

Imagine you’re a project manager and one of the developers on your team lets you know that a new function is ready for testing. Instead of contacting a SysAdmin or a DevOps engineer, you’re able to set up testing or staging environments in an instant by creating a new Node, described in the Register your first Node tutorial.

If you’re running dyrector.io on-premises, the process is even more simple. All you have to do is deploy the application you’d like to test to the Node where dyrector.io runs using the steps of Create the Product tutorial.

**And more, including**

* Installing Next.js apps with Nginx to a VPS or a Kubernetes cluster
* Installing single images (like RabbitMQ or a database)
* Checking server/cluster status
