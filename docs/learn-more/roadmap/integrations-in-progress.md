# Integrations in progress

### GitLab CI/CD & GitHub Action

dyrector.io isn’t a CI/CD tool but it covers certain steps of CD and its management related aspects.

Both GitLab’s CI/CD and GitHub’s Action tools can be integrated to dyrector.io. Its main benefit is that dyrector.io enables you to manage multi-instance deployments to different environments, and it enables you to manage several different configurations.

This means dyrector.io is the ultimate complementary platform to extend your already existing CI/CD pipeline’s capabilities.

By using dyrector.io, you can bring multiple services and operational practices under the same hood.

* **Deployments:** you can integrate the services and pipelines you already use to build your applications, and then deploy them to any desired environment.
* **Change log generation:** increase the transparency of version management by generating change logs based on commit messages left by your developers.
* **Configuration management:** simplified configuration management to keep your infrastructure under control while you focus on delivering value to your users.
* **Secrets management:** HashiCorp’s Vault integration enables you to store your sensible keys, configuration variables, tokens and other things secure.
* **Monitoring:** get notifications and alerts on multiple channels about what happens on your infrastructure.
