# Multi-instance deployments

Deploying the same application to several environments is demanding, boring and repetitive. Human presence makes it risky, too. That’s why reducing the steps of multi-instance deployments are crucial for efficiency.

With dyrector.io, you can trigger multi-instance deployments by assembling your product out of the desired images and selecting the Nodes you want the app to be deployed to. All this without coding. To see how you can do these steps, check our tutorials where we lead you through the process step-by-step.

#### Use cases

* **Set up Nodes:** once you set up your Nodes, you can trigger deployments to them in an instant.&#x20;
* **In progress – Bundled configurations:** without specifying the same configurations again and again, you can specify bundled variables in an instant. Learn more about them under the Configuration management tab of Features.&#x20;
