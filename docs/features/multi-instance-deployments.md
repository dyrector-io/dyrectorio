# Multi-Instance Deployments

Deploying the same application to several environments is demanding, boring and repetitive. Human presence makes it risky, too. That’s why reducing the steps of multi-instance deployments are crucial for efficiency.

With dyrector.io, you can trigger multi-instance deployments by assembling your product out of the desired images and selecting the Nodes you want the app to be deployed to. All this without coding. To see how you can do these steps, check the [**Tutorials**](broken-reference) where we lead you through the process step-by-step.

#### Use cases
