# Create a Rolling Version

Rolling Versions are similar to Simple Products except they’re perfect for continuous delivery. They’re always mutable but contrary to incremental Products they aren’t hierarchic and lack a version number.

**Step 1:** After picking Rolling on the switch, click ‘Save’. You’ll be directed to the Product tab. Select the product again.

**Step 2:** Click ‘Add version’.

**Step 3:** Enter the rolling version's name and specify a changelog.
