  "mounts": ["data|/var/lib/mysql"],
<strong>  // Maps an internal 80 to external 8080, external refers to the host's port.
</strong>  "ports": [
    {
      "internal": 80,
      "external": 8080
    }
  ],
  // Docker specific networkMode configuration, can be host or none.
  "networkMode": "none",
  // Environment variables used to configure application behavior.
  // Tribute to https://12factor.net
  "environment": {},
  // WIP (not available yet) configure container behavior based on annotations.
  "capabilities": {},
  // If managed ingress is enabled on node (traefik or ingress is deployed)
  // ingress could be generated here. This is for http traffic for now.
  "expose": {"public": true, "tls": true}
}</code></pre>
