# dyrector.io docs

dyrector.io is an open-source deployment platform that helps software teams manage releases & deployments easily and efficiently. While non-specialists are enabled to manage these processes in a simplified, self-service manner, specialists can deploy and manage containerized apps faster. Find out what you can do with dyrector.io!

**You can find dyrector.io's GitHub repository** [**here**](https://github.com/dyrector-io/dyrectorio/)**. Feel free to contribute!**

## Concept

**Life isn’t about release management.** Why should teams focus so much of their precious time and effort on it when things can be simpler?

dyrector.io is for you if you’d like to shift your team’s focus from repeatable steps of multi-instance deployments to delivering value to your users. And when a deployment is successful or any error occurs, the team gets notified so they can react as soon as possible.

There are myriads of tools teams use for system administration and release management. With dyrector.io, you can use them all from the same application. You're also able to manage configurations simple and secure on dyrector.io with the support of HashiCorp’s Vault.

Often certain tasks, like changelog creation or monitoring your infrastructure and configurations feel overwhelming. By using dyrector.io, you can help your teammates to get these things done without feeling like it’s all a waste of time.

While dyrector.io enables non-technical staff members to help with certain tasks, it’s also useful to reduce time technical staff spend on deployment and system administration.
