### Concept

**Life isn’t about release management.** Why should teams focus so much of their precious time and effort on it when things can be simpler?

dyrector.io is for you if you’d like to shift your team’s focus from repeatable steps of multi-instance deployments to delivering value to your users. And when a deployment is successful or any error occurs, the team gets notified so they can react as soon as possible.

While dyrector.io enables non-technical staff members to help with certain tasks, it’s also useful to reduce time technical staff spend on deployment and system administration.
