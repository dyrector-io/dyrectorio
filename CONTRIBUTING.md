## Code of Conduct

Help us keep dyrector.io open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Git branching strategy

We have two persistent branches: main, develop. 
PRs are going into develop.
The develop branch is always fast-forward mergable to main.
PR titles must follow the conventional commit guidelines.

Release: a release commit is made to develop, package versions are bumped, develop is fast-forward merged into main.
Hotfix: in rare occassions, a hotfix/** branch is created from main and the PR targets the main branch,
develop must be rebased to main -- using rebase-onto.

## Submit a Pull Request

Branch naming convention is as following

`TYPE/DESCRIPTION-DESCRIPTION`

When `TYPE` can be:

-   `chore/` - Formatting, style, repository structure, or version updates that do not affect functionality.
-   `cicd/` - Changes related to the CI/CD system, such as build script or configuration updates.
-   `doc/` - Changes focused on documentation updates, including README files, documentation files, or code comments.
-   `feat/` - Implementation of new features or functionality.
-   `fix/` - Resolution of bugs or issues in the codebase.
-   `hotfix/` - Urgent bug fixes on the main branch to address critical issues.
-   `refactor/` - Code changes to improve structure, readability, or maintainability.
-   `test/` - Changes related to testing, including adding or modifying test cases or improving the testing infrastructure.

All PRs must include a commit message with the changes described.

dyrector.io is following Conventional Commits, the commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of dyrector.io library:

1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
   A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
1. _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [the Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`,
   `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
1. _footers_ other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` may be provided and follow a convention similar to
   [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).
